  synopsis: |
    `debops.nat` is a helper role which configures internal network on
    a separate bridge interface with NAT or MASQUERADE firewall configuration
    (the network will use a non-routable IP address space and access to the Internet
    will be provided by the host operating system). This network can be used as
    a development environment for virtual machines or containers.
    
    Configuration of iptables firewall, forwarding and network interfaces will
    be performed by the `debops.ferm` and `debops.ifupdown` roles.
    
    You can use `dnsmasq` server (available via `debops.dnsmasq` Ansible
    role) to complete the network configuration and provide internal DNS/DHCP
    server.
